## üßπ Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)

We are given 2 tables (services data and branch date) from which to construct the necesary queried tables and relevant KPIs for dashboard construction later on. The following tables were extracted and transformed using SQL.

---

### üåé Table: Revenue by region

```sql
SELECT 
  b.Region,
  SUM(s.total_revenue) AS TotalRevenue 
FROM 
  [ServiceBranch].[dbo].[services_data] AS s 
  JOIN [ServiceBranch].[dbo].[branch_data] AS b 
  ON s.branch_id = b.Branch_ID 
GROUP BY 
  b.Region
ORDER BY 
  TotalRevenue DESC;
```

---

### üíº Table: Revenue by department

```sql
SELECT 
  department, 
  SUM(total_revenue) AS TotalRevenue 
FROM 
  [ServiceBranch].[dbo].[services_data]
GROUP BY 
  department 
ORDER BY 
  TotalRevenue DESC;
```
---

### üë®‚Äçüíº Table: Revenue by customer

 ```sql
SELECT
  client_name, SUM(total_revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM 
  [ServiceBranch].[dbo].[services_data]
GROUP BY
  client_name
ORDER BY
  TotalRevenue DESC;
 ```
---

### üí≤ KPI: Total revenue

 ```sql
SELECT
  SUM(total_revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM
  [ServiceBranch].[dbo].[services_data];
 ```
---

### üïí KPI: Total hours

 ```sql
SELECT
  SUM(hours) AS TotalHours
FROM
  [ServiceBranch].[dbo].[services_data];
 ```
---

### üïí KPI: Revenue by department over overall revenue

 ```sql
SELECT 
  department, 
  SUM(total_revenue) AS DepartmentRevenue, 
  (
    SUM(total_revenue) / (
      SELECT 
        SUM(total_revenue) 
      FROM 
        [ServiceBranch].[dbo].[services_data]
    )
  ) * 100 AS RevenuePercentage 
FROM 
  [ServiceBranch].[dbo].[services_data] 
GROUP BY 
  department;
 ```
---

### üìà KPI: Month on month percentage increase

 ```sql
WITH 
  MonthlyRevenue AS (
    SELECT
      FORMAT(service_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
	  SUM(total_revenue) AS Revenue
    FROM
      [ServiceBranch].[dbo].[services_data]
    GROUP BY
      FORMAT(service_date, 'yyyy-MM')
    ),
  RevenueComparison AS (
    SELECT
	  Month,
	  Revenue,
	  LAG(Revenue) OVER (ORDER BY Month) AS PreviousMonthRevenue
	FROM
	  MonthlyRevenue
    )
SELECT
  Month,
  Revenue,
  PreviousMonthRevenue,
  CASE WHEN PreviousMonthRevenue > 0 THEN ((Revenue - PreviousMonthRevenue) /
  PreviousMonthRevenue) * 100 ELSE NULL END AS RevenuePercentageIncrease
FROM
  RevenueComparison
WHERE
  PreviousMonthRevenue IS NOT NULL;
 ```
